Robotics is an interesting and fast-growing field. Being a branch of engineering, the applications of robotics are increasing with the advancement of technology.

The concept of Mobile Robot is fast evolving and the number of mobile robots and their complexities are increasing with different applications.

There are many types of mobile robot navigation techniques like path planning, self – localization and map interpreting. An Obstacle Avoiding Robot is a type of autonomous mobile robot that avoids collision with unexpected obstacles.


In this project, an Obstacle Avoiding Robot controlled by a bluetooth enabled joystick is designed. It is an
Arduino based robot that uses Ultrasonic range finder sensors to avoid collisions.
